# Apps on K8s

Trying different applications on Kubernetes. The applications are in an all-in-one format, meaning an ELK stack installation contains a single file, which has all components in it. These have been primarily tested on GKE. Might need small changes to run on other K8 setups.

## Installation

Use kubectl to install them. Planning to include helm charts as I progress.

```bash
kubectl apply -f required-file.yaml.
```

## Usage

```bash
kubectl apply -f required-file.yaml.
```
